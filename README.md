# DSP-Echo-Effect

This is an easy demonstration that uses convolution to demonstrate the effect of echo. It includes a documentation and a MATLAB file.

## Documentation

The documentation provides detailed information on how the echo effect is implemented using convolution. It explains the theory behind the effect and provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the MATLAB file to generate the echo effect.

## MATLAB File

The MATLAB file included in this repository demonstrates the echo effect using convolution. It contains the necessary code to apply the echo effect to an audio signal. The file is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a useful resource for learning about convolution and the echo effect.

To use the MATLAB file, follow these steps:
1. Open MATLAB on your computer.
2. Load the audio signal you want to apply the echo effect to.
3. Run the MATLAB file and follow the instructions provided in the comments.
4. Listen to the output audio signal with the echo effect applied.

Please refer to the documentation for more information on how to use the MATLAB file and understand the underlying concepts.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone or download the code to your local machine. You can then open the MATLAB file in MATLAB and start experimenting with the echo effect. Make sure you have the necessary audio signal to apply the effect to.
